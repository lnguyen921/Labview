1. Sorting an Array using While to sort only even numbers:
   - Instructions:
       a. Create a while loop
       b. Create input of an array of number
       c. Divide and check if quotient is = 0, this condition will allow us to sort the numbers and see if any is an even number.
       d. It should output an array of even number from an indicator
       e. create an Array size for the output of original array.
       f. Array size will decrement and compare with the iteration.
       g. When array size is equal to iteration, then While loop stops executing.
